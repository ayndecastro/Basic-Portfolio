            <p>My name is Vincent Ayn de Castro, Ayn for short. I'm from the philippines. I moved to austin about 2 and a half year ago with my brother and sister. Before Coding Bootcamp I was a pre-med student, I did 4 years in the philippines, I didn't finish because I moved here. I tried to finish it here, so I went to ACC for two semester until a friend Lance encouraged me to join the bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Right now I work at Party Barn - a really good part-time if you're going to school - we sell beer and wine. I like the job, it pays good money for a part-time but there just isn't going up with this. Coding will be a good way to better my situation financially, and it'll fund an expensive hobby of mine which is cars.</p>
            <p>I also feel like this is a great job for someone who loves to travel. that's kind of the plan, hopefully I'd be good at it, enough so that my employers let me travel!</p>
